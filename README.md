# noise_robust_CSC
The codes implement the method described in "A Noise-Robust Online Convolutional Sparse Coding
Model and Its Applications to Poisson Denoising and Image Fusion".


To train the dictionary using clear fruit data or city data, run demon_trainfruit_OCSC.m.

To train the dictionary using noisy fruit data, run trainwithnoise_fruit.m.

To produce the denoised results described in Table II of our manuscript, run Table2.m.
